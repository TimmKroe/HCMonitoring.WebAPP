# hcmonitoring.webapp
Hetzner Cloud Monitoring is an all in one Solution for a public status page or an internal basic monitoring of servers.
It is built on top of the Hetzner Cloud API, has a VueJS Frontend with TailwindCSS and a C# .NET Core Backend.

The API Backend is [here](https://github.com/TimmKroe/HCMonitoring.WebAPI).

This Repo is mirrored from: https://gitlab.com/timmkroe/HCMonitoring-WebAPP

## Installation
TODO

## IssueTracker
For development I use Youtrack located [here](https://youtrack.timmkroe.de/youtrack/agiles/100-26/101-28). If you have any problems with the software or requests please still use the Github Issue Tracker.

## Support
The first thing you should do if you have any issue with the software is looking into the issues tab.
If there is no solution to your problem create your own issue.

## Contributing
Expected workflow is: Fork -> Patch -> Push -> Pull Request

## Project Status
This project is still in early development.

## Roadmap - First stable Release
- [ ] a complete Solution - Container maybe?
- [ ] JWT Auth Flow (in relation to Backend) / User Accounts
